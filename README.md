# Humanities LLM Tutor Project 2026

## Project Overview

### What I Built

I designed and built a **Socratic LLM tutor for MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW)** humanities and social sciences courses, intended as a deployable tool for students working through OCW assignments. The tutor is constrained to never give direct answers — it uses guided discovery, bite-sized responses, and formative feedback to walk students through assignments on topics like the trolley problem in philosophy or climate geography in urban studies.

To evaluate and improve the tutor before deployment, I built a complete validation framework alongside it: adversarial AI student bots that each probe a specific failure mode (demanding answers under pressure, going off-topic, lecturing a lost student), an LLM judge that grades conversations against a structured rubric, and a visualization module that compares GPT and Claude judge scores across all transcripts. The dashboard lets me browse every conversation and its grades side-by-side.

The primary deliverable is the tutor. The student bots, judge, and charts exist to stress-test it systematically across different student personalities, courses, and difficulty levels before it reaches real learners.

### Why I Built It

- **Deployment goal:** Deliver a reliable Socratic tutor for OCW that guides students through humanities assignments without giving answers directly — working across the range of student types and engagement levels OCW sees in practice.
- **Validation goal:** Build a reproducible evaluation framework so tutor behaviour can be tested, graded, and compared across prompt versions before any version goes live.

## Technical Overview

### System Architecture

The system has four loosely coupled layers:

- Conversation pipeline: two LangGraph agents (tutor + student) trade messages in a structured multi-turn loop, each independently configurable via system prompt files
- Judge pipeline: a separate LangGraph agent reads a finished transcript and returns a structured JSON grade against a rubric, supporting both single-transcript and bundle (holistic, 3-transcript) grading
- Bundle experiment system: three experiment types — consistency, cross-exercise, persona differentiation — each covering 198 pre-generated bundle files with zero transcript overlap
- Dashboard + visualization: a Flask web app for browsing transcripts side-by-side with GPT/Claude grades, and a matplotlib chart module for Pearson r / Spearman rho correlation analysis

### Key Components

**Tutor Agent (`tutor/run_tutor.py`):** A LangGraph graph with a single node that calls GPT and returns a two-field JSON response — internal pedagogical reasoning (hidden from students) and a student-facing answer. The system prompt is loaded from a versioned `.txt` file and can be overridden with an assignment block at runtime.

**Student Bot (`students/run_student.py`):** Shares the same LangGraph infrastructure as the tutor, but uses a persona prompt from `students/personas/` to simulate a specific type of student. Includes a heuristic guard and automatic retry if the bot starts sounding like a tutor.

**Judge (`judge/run_judge.py`):** Reads a transcript, constructs a grading prompt by injecting the rubric and output schema, and calls the selected provider (`gpt` or `claude`). Validates the JSON response against the rubric spec, auto-repairs on failure up to 3 attempts, and writes the grade back into the transcript file. The current rubric (`rubric_05`, 46 pts) scores three sections: Pedagogy (24 pts — Socratic method, scaffolding, meta-learning), Dialogue Quality (12 pts — redundancy, assignment anchoring), and Communication Quality (10 pts — bite-sized responses, tone).

**Bundle Judge (`judge/run_judge_bundle.py`):** Combines 3 transcripts into one prompt for holistic, comparative grading using the selected provider — allowing consistency and persona differentiation analysis across a set.

**UI Runners (`ui/`):** Three parallelized runners using `ThreadPoolExecutor` (default 6 workers) — raw transcript generation, individual transcript judging, and bundle judging. All judge runners accept `--provider`, `--prompt`, and `--rubric` CLI flags.

**Dashboard (`dashboard_ui/`):** Flask app that discovers all transcripts and bundle files on disk, loads GPT and Claude grades for each, and serves a sortable comparison table and per-transcript detail view via a single-page JS frontend.

## Code in Action: Conversation Flow Example

### 1. Tutor Prompt (`tutor/prompts/tutor_03.txt`)

- Instructs the tutor to never state the answer directly
- Requires guided questions that move the student toward insights themselves
- Limits responses to one or two focused questions or observations per turn

### 2. Student Persona (`students/personas/chaotic_01.txt`)

- Simulates a student who pushes back against Socratic questioning
- Demands direct answers and complains the method is unhelpful
- Tests whether the tutor holds its role under social pressure

### 3. Resulting Conversation (`transcripts/chaotic/chaotic_raw/transcript_0001.json`)

- Student opens by demanding the answer directly, refusing to engage
- Tutor deflects with a targeted question about the student's existing understanding
- Student reluctantly engages, making small correct steps each turn
- Tutor acknowledges progress and raises the next sub-question without giving away the conclusion

### 4. Judge Output (grade written back into the transcript JSON)

- Three sections scored: Pedagogy, Dialogue Quality, Communication Quality
- Per-criterion deductions include a sub-criterion ID, turn evidence, reason, and point value
- Total score, max score, overview paragraph, and full judge reasoning all recorded alongside the grade

## How the Workflow Runs

**1. Load prompts and build agents**

```python
system_prompt = load_system_prompt("tutor_03", assignment_override=assignment_text)
tutor_graph = create_tutor_graph(system_prompt)
student_graph = build_graph(prompt_name="chaotic_01")
```

**2. Run the multi-turn conversation loop**

```python
for turn_index in range(config.turn_size):
    student_msg = get_next_student_message(student_messages, graph=student_graph)
    tutor_messages, tutor_text = get_tutor_reply(tutor_messages, graph=tutor_graph)
```

**3. Save the raw transcript to disk**

```python
payload = {
    "tutor_prompt": "tutor_03", "student_persona": "chaotic_01",
    "course": "philosophy", "exercise_number": "01",
    "exchanges": transcript_exchanges,
}
transcript_path.write_text(json.dumps(payload, indent=2))
```

**4. Grade the transcript with the judge**

```python
result = judge_transcript(
    "chaotic/chaotic_gpt/transcript_0001",
    provider="gpt",
    prompt_name="judge_05",
    rubric_name="rubric_05",
)
print(result.total_score, result.max_score)  # e.g. 38, 46
```

**5. Grade a bundle of 3 transcripts together**

```python
result = judge_transcript_bundle(
    "transcripts/bundles/bundles_raw/bundle_01/bundle_001.txt",
    provider="gpt",
    prompt_name="judge_05",
    rubric_name="rubric_05",
    output_path="transcripts/bundles/bundles_gpt/bundle_01/bundle_001.json",
)
```

**6. Generate score comparison charts**

```powershell
python -m visualization.run_visualization
# Output: visualization/outputs/individual_grades_gpt_vs_claude.png
```

## Current Status

The full pipeline is working end-to-end, with:

- 3 persona families × 6 variants each (chaotic, cooperative, clueless) — 18 student personas total
- 2 courses: `philosophy` (1 exercise) and `urban_studies` (3 exercises)
- 288 raw transcripts per persona type — 864 total files across raw, GPT-graded, and Claude-graded folders
- 198 bundle files across 3 experiment types (72 + 54 + 72), covering 594 unique transcripts with zero overlap
- Rubric versioned up to `rubric_06` (current default: `rubric_05`, 46 pts)
- Dashboard fully functional for side-by-side GPT/Claude grade comparison
- Visualization outputs Pearson r and Spearman rho between GPT and Claude scores at section and subsection level

## Challenges and How I Solved Them

- **Keeping the tutor in Socratic mode:** Getting GPT to never reveal answers required extensive prompt engineering. Added pedagogical reasoning as a separate JSON field so the model "thinks out loud" before answering, which consistently improves restraint.
- **Adversarial student bots that sound like tutors:** The student LangGraph node includes a heuristic that detects tutor-like phrasing (numbered agendas, coaching frameworks) and auto-retries with a correction message before returning the response.
- **LLM judge output validation:** Judge responses sometimes came back with float scores, missing fields, or malformed JSON. Built a multi-strategy extraction pipeline (raw JSON → fenced code block → brace extraction → `ast.literal_eval`) with up to 3 repair-and-retry cycles.
- **Bundle experiment design:** Ensuring zero transcript overlap within each bundle type while maintaining balanced coverage across personas and courses required a careful grouping algorithm. Each of the 198 bundles contains exactly 3 unique transcripts with no transcript appearing twice in the same bundle type.
- **GPT vs Claude grade alignment:** Initial rubric versions produced high inter-judge variance. Migrating to `rubric_05` (simplified scoring, no malus deductions, mandatory sub-criterion IDs on deductions) measurably improved GPT/Claude correlation.
- **Inconsistent judge output schemas:** Different model versions and prompt iterations produced criteria in three different JSON shapes (flat keys, nested `criteria` dict, score under `base`). Built a normalization layer applied at write time and retroactively migrated all 927 graded transcripts with criterion data to a single canonical format.

## Future Possibilities

- Statistical analysis of bundle experiment results (score variance, exercise difficulty effects, persona differentiation scores)
- Additional student persona families and course subjects
- Human-in-the-loop evaluation to calibrate the LLM judge against human graders
- Streaming live conversations through the dashboard UI
- ML-assisted rubric refinement based on judge disagreement patterns

## TL;DR

A Socratic LLM tutor built for MIT OpenCourseWare that guides students through humanities assignments using guided discovery and never gives answers directly—validated against simulated adversarial conversations, graded automatically by GPT & Claude judges across a structured rubric, and analyzed to measure judge consistency before deployment.
