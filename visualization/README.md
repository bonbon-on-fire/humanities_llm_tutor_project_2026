# Visualization

Generate score comparison charts for GPT vs Claude transcript grading.

## Inputs

Reads judged transcript JSON files from:

- `transcripts/<persona_type>/<persona_type>_gpt/transcript_*.json`
- `transcripts/<persona_type>/<persona_type>_claude/transcript_*.json`
- `transcripts/<persona_type>/<persona_type>_gpt_v2/transcript_*.json`
- `transcripts/<persona_type>/<persona_type>_claude_v2/transcript_*.json`
- `transcripts/<persona_type>/<persona_type>_gpt_v3/transcript_*.json`
- `transcripts/<persona_type>/<persona_type>_claude_v3/transcript_*.json`
- `transcripts/bundles/bundles_gpt/bundle_<type>/bundle_*.json`
- `transcripts/bundles/bundles_claude/bundle_<type>/bundle_*.json`
- `transcripts/bundles/bundles_gpt_v2/bundle_<type>/bundle_*.json`
- `transcripts/bundles/bundles_claude_v2/bundle_<type>/bundle_*.json`
- `transcripts/bundles/bundles_gpt_v3/bundle_<type>/bundle_*.json`
- `transcripts/bundles/bundles_claude_v3/bundle_<type>/bundle_*.json`

Individual transcript grading is generated as one combined chart across all transcripts.
Bundle Type 01 charts are also generated separately for each persona family.

## Run

```powershell
python -m visualization.run_visualization
```

## Alignment

Individual transcripts are matched across providers by composite key:
`student_persona | course | exercise_number | transcript_name`.

Bundle files are matched by filename (e.g. `bundle_001`).

Missing rows in either provider appear as gaps (NaN) in the line charts.
