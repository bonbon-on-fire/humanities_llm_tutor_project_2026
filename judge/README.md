# Judge

LLM-based grader that scores tutor–student conversation transcripts against a rubric.

## Structure

```
judge/
  __init__.py          — package exports
  run_judge.py         — LangGraph engine, validation, scoring logic
  rubric_01.md         — grading rubric (deduction-based, 33 base + 12 bonus = 45 max)
  README.md
  prompts/
    judge_01.txt       — judge system prompt template (references rubric + schema)
```

Transcripts live in the top-level `transcripts/` folder (not inside `judge/`).

## How it works

1. Loads the judge system prompt from `prompts/judge_01.txt`, injecting the rubric text from `rubric_01.md` and the expected JSON schema.
2. Reads a transcript JSON from `transcripts/<name>.json`.
3. Formats the conversation and sends it to the LLM with the system prompt.
4. Parses the LLM's JSON response, sanitizes numeric values, and validates against the schema.
5. If validation fails, sends a repair prompt and retries once (up to 2 attempts total).
6. Writes a `grade` object back into the transcript JSON file.

## Usage

```python
from judge import judge_transcript

result = judge_transcript("chaotic_01_exercise_01_01")
print(result.total_score, result.max_score)  # e.g. 38.5, 45.0
```
